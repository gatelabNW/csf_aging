## Abstract
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contains a tightly regulated, specialized immune system. Yet, little is known about how
CSF immunity is altered with aging or neurodegenerative disease. Here, we performed single cell RNA
sequencing (scRNAseq) on CSF collected from 45 cognitively normal subjects ranging from 54-82 years old. We
then assessed age-related transcriptomic changes using bioinformatic approaches, including linear and local
polynomial regression. We reveal increased expression of lipid transport genes _Apolipoprotein E (APOE)_,
_Apolipoprotein C1 (APOC1)_ and _Phospholipid Transfer Protein (PLTP)_ in activated monocytes with age. We then
compared CSF immune systems from cognitively normal subjects to 14 subjects with mild cognitive impairment
or Alzheimerâ€™s disease. In cognitively impaired subjects, downregulation of lipid transport genes in activated
monocytes occurred concomitantly with altered antigen presentation and cytokine signaling to CD8 T cells.
Clonally expanded CD8 T cells upregulated _C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 6 (CXCR6)_ in cognitively impaired
subjects. The CXCR6 ligand, C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 16 (CXCL16), a chemoattractant and lipoprotein
scavenger receptor, was elevated in CSF of cognitively impaired subjects and correlated with neuroaxonal
damage. Cumulatively, these results identify the CXCL16-CXCR6 signaling axis as a mechanism for antigenspecific
T cell entry into brains with neurodegeneration.

## About
This repository contains code used to process and analyze scRNA-TCRseq data from the **Distinct cerebrospinal fluid immune perturbations in healthy brain aging and cognitive impairment** study. 

All ```R``` dependencies are listed in the ```renv.lock``` file. Upon opening the ```csf_aging.Rproj``` file in ```Rstudio```, the ```renv``` package should automatically download and activate. Afterwards, the user can run ```renv::restore()``` to download all necessary packages for the study. 

The dataset can be viewed and analyzed interactively in our [modified ShinyCell app](https://gatelabnu.shinyapps.io/csf_aging/).

Raw .fastq files and gene expression matrices can be downloaded from [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE200164), post-publicatoin
